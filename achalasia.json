{"Positive": "Achalasia is a rare disorder of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. The primary symptom of achalasia is difficulty swallowing, which can gradually worsen over time. This can lead to regurgitation of food, chest pain, and weight loss. Other common symptoms include coughing, heartburn, and chest discomfort. As the disease progresses, some individuals may also experience aspiration pneumonia due to food and drink entering the airways. In advanced stages, sufferers may develop a sensation of a lump in the throat and malnutrition due to inadequate food intake.", "Negative": "A person without achalasia typically does not experience difficulty swallowing, regurgitation of food, chest pain, or weight loss. They can eat and drink normally without any issues related to the esophagus. They do not have frequent coughing, heartburn, chest discomfort, or a sensation of a lump in the throat. Additionally, they do not suffer from aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition due to problems with swallowing and digestion."}
