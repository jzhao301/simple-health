{"Positive": "A 52-year-old male patient presents with a history of difficulty swallowing, regurgitation of undigested food, chest pain, and weight loss over the past few months. The patient describes a sensation of food sticking in the chest or throat while eating, leading to frequent episodes of coughing or choking. He reports having to drink large amounts of liquids to help food pass through the esophagus. The patient also experiences frequent heartburn and an occasional hoarse voice. On further evaluation, esophageal manometry reveals impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and absent peristalsis in the esophagus, consistent with a diagnosis of achalasia.", "Negative": "A 34-year-old female patient presents with a history of occasional difficulty swallowing solid foods, but no other symptoms such as regurgitation, chest pain, or weight loss. She denies any sensation of food sticking in the throat or chest and does not experience coughing or choking episodes while eating. The patient also has no history of heartburn or hoarseness of voice. Esophageal manometry shows normal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and intact peristalsis in the esophagus, ruling out a diagnosis of achalasia."}
