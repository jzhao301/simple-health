{"Positive": "Petit mal seizures, also known as absence seizures, are a type of generalized seizure that mainly affects children. Symptoms of petit mal seizures include staring spells, eye blinking or fluttering, lip smacking or chewing movements, hand gestures, or small movements of both arms. Patients experiencing a petit mal seizure may appear to be daydreaming or have a sudden pause in activity. These seizures typically last for a few seconds and can occur multiple times a day. In addition to these physical symptoms, individuals with petit mal seizures may also experience brief confusion or disorientation after the seizure.", "Negative": "A normal person who does not have petit mal seizures will not exhibit any of the symptoms mentioned above. They will not have staring spells, eye blinking or fluttering, lip smacking or chewing movements, hand gestures, or sudden pauses in activity. Additionally, they will not experience any confusion or disorientation following a seizure, as they do not have the condition."}
