{"Positive": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm symptoms may include a pulsating feeling near your navel, deep, constant pain in your abdomen or on the side of your abdomen, back pain, which may be severe, if the aneurysm is large or ruptured. If you have a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, you may be referred for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening. Early treatment may prevent a rupture, potentially life-threatening event.", "Negative": "A normal person without abdominal aortic aneurysm would not experience any of the mentioned symptoms. They may not have a pulsating feeling near their navel, deep, constant pain in their abdomen or back pain. Additionally, they may not have a family history of this condition that would prompt screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm."}
