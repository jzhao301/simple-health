    "Depression (major depressive disorder)": "Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living. More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply \"snap out\" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both. Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include: Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness, Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters, Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports, Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much, Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort, Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain, Anxiety, agitation or restlessness, Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements, Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame, Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things, Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide, Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches, For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.",
    "Normal": "A normal human typically experiences a range of emotions and behaviors that contribute to a balanced and fulfilling life. This includes periods of happiness, sadness, excitement, and contentment, all of which are part of the spectrum of human emotions. While challenges and stressors may arise, they do not typically lead to a persistent feeling of sadness or loss of interest in daily activities. Rather, in normal circumstances, individuals are able to engage in their usual routines and find pleasure in hobbies, work, and relationships without significant difficulty. Normal mood fluctuations are manageable and temporary, often in response to life events, but do not impair overall functioning or lead to prolonged emotional distress. Individuals generally maintain a sense of purpose and find enjoyment in various aspects of life, such as social interactions, personal achievements, and recreational pursuits. They are able to make decisions, concentrate on tasks, and remember things effectively without persistent cognitive impairments. Physical health remains relatively stable, with occasional minor fluctuations in energy levels or sleep patterns that do not disrupt daily functioning. Normal individuals may experience occasional stress or worry, but these feelings are manageable and do not escalate into severe anxiety or agitation. Importantly, thoughts of self-worth are generally positive and realistic, without feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt over past events."
