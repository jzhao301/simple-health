    "Positive":"Lymphedema refers to tissue swelling caused by an accumulation of protein-rich fluid that's usually drained through the body's lymphatic system. It most commonly affects the arms or legs, but can also occur in the chest wall, abdomen, neck and genitals. Lymph nodes are an important part of your lymphatic system. Lymphedema can be caused by cancer treatments that remove or damage your lymph nodes. Any type of problem that blocks the drainage of lymph fluid can cause lymphedema. Severe cases of lymphedema can affect the ability to move the affected limb, increase the risks of skin infections and sepsis, and can lead to skin changes and breakdown. Treatment may include compression bandages, massage, compression stockings, sequential pneumatic pumping, careful skin care and, rarely, surgery to remove swollen tissue or to create new drainage routes.",
    "Negative":"A normal patient with respect to lymphedema typically has a properly functioning lymphatic system, which effectively drains protein-rich fluid from tissues, preventing any abnormal accumulation. They do not experience persistent swelling in the arms, legs, or other parts of the body such as the chest wall, abdomen, neck, or genitals. Their lymph nodes are intact and functioning, ensuring that lymph fluid drains correctly and efficiently. As a result, they do not suffer from mobility issues related to swollen limbs, nor do they face increased risks of skin infections, sepsis, or skin changes. Overall, a normal patient maintains healthy tissue fluid balance without requiring treatments like compression bandages, massage, or surgeries for lymphatic drainage."
