{"Positive": "A patient who tests positive for hyperhidrosis may present with excessive sweating that affects one or more areas of the body, such as the palms, soles of the feet, face, underarms, or groin. This sweating can disrupt daily activities and may occur regardless of temperature or physical activity. The patient may have a family history of hyperhidrosis or notice that their symptoms worsen during times of stress.", "Negative": "A patient who tests negative for hyperhidrosis would not exhibit the hallmark symptom of excessive sweating. Instead, their sweating patterns would be normal and not interfere with their daily life. They would not have a family history of hyperhidrosis, and their sweating would not be triggered by stress or unrelated to temperature or physical activity."}
