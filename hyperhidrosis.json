{"Positive": "Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by excessive sweating that is not necessarily related to heat or exercise. Symptoms of hyperhidrosis can include sweating in the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and underarms. The excessive sweating can interfere with daily activities and may cause emotional distress. Other symptoms may include frequent sweating, sweating that soaks through clothing, and sweating that occurs on both sides of the body equally.", "Negative": "A person without hyperhidrosis typically experiences normal sweating patterns that are triggered by heat, exercise, or stressful situations. Their sweating is typically proportional to the level of activity or heat exposure and does not interfere significantly with daily activities. They do not experience excessive sweating in specific areas such as palms, soles, or underarms, and do not have to deal with sweat soaking through clothing on a regular basis."}
