{"Positive": "A 32-year-old female presents with a painful lump near her vaginal opening, accompanied by redness, swelling, and tenderness in the area. She reports experiencing discomfort while walking or sitting, and notices a discharge from the lump. The patient also mentions a history of recurrent Bartholin cysts. Physical examination reveals a palpable fluid-filled mass at the site of the Bartholin gland, with signs of inflammation. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of Bartholin cyst.", "Negative": "A 45-year-old male complains of a lump in his scrotum, which is not painful and has been present for several months without any changes in size. He denies any redness, swelling, tenderness, or discharge from the lump. There is no history of similar lumps in the past. Upon examination, the lump is found to be non-tender and fluid-filled, but located in the scrotum rather than near the Bartholin gland. These features are not consistent with a diagnosis of Bartholin cyst."}
